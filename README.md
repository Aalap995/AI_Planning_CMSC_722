  - Incorporating Planning into an Actor  
2) Deliberation with Reﬁnement Methods
  - Operational Models
  - A Reﬁnement Acting Engine
  - Reﬁnement Planning 
    -Sequential Reﬁnement Planning
  - Acting and Reﬁnement Planning
3) Deliberation with Temporal Models
  - Temporal Representation
  - Planning with Temporal Reﬁnement Methods 
  - Constraint Management
