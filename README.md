# AI_Planning_CMSC_722
Repository covers AI planning course taught by prof Dana Nau at University of Maryland.
The course covers topics listed below :
# 1) Deliberation with Deterministic Models
  - Planning domain repersentation: classical approach
  - Forward State-Space Search 
  - Heuristic Functions (Delete-Relaxation Heuristics)
  - Backward Search 
  - Plan-Space Search
  - Incorporating Planning into an Actor  
# 2) Deliberation with Reﬁnement Methods
  - Operational Models
  - A Reﬁnement Acting Engine
  - Reﬁnement Planning 
    -Sequential Reﬁnement Planning
  - Acting and Reﬁnement Planning
# 3) Deliberation with Temporal Models
  - Temporal Representation
  - Planning with Temporal Reﬁnement Methods 
  - Constraint Management
    -Path consistency Algorithm (consistent system check and upadation algorithm)
  - Acting with Temporal Models
 # 4) Deliberation with Nondeterministic Models 
 # 5) Deliberation with Probabilistic Models
 # Project 1 Comparing Domain-Speciﬁc and Domain-Independent Planning
  - Programmed Racetrack game in PDDL
  - Developed python script to generate diiferent problem domains 
  - Carfted a python simulation that displays the problem domain and the path using matplot lib 
  - Reported difference between Domain-Speciﬁc and Domain-Independent Planning
    - CPU time with GBFS (2 different heuristics)
    - Node generation with GBFS (2 different heuristics)
